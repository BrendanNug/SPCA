SPCA - CISC 332


Database Setup

To load the database. the main file to set it up is SPCA_DB.sql and to work with the rest of the program, the database must be 
called spca_db. The data to fill the tables is in spca_data.sql.


Using the program

The home page is index.html. From here you can either access the donations area in the top left corner, see all animals in the 
system by using the link in the bottom middle, or you can access the animals and the staff login through the menu icon in the 
top right corner. 

The staff login page is just there for show. Just click log in nd you will be brought to the staff portal. 

In the staff portal, you have access to the required functions of the program. The buttons at the top of the page will take you to 
another page to fill in the required fields. The ones mat the bottom will just reload the table on the staff portal page to reflect 
your selection.
